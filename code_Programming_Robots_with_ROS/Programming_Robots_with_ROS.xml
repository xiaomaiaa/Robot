            <p id="p_000012" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000012">ROS, the Robot Operating System, is an open source framework for getting robots to do things. ROS is meant to serve as a common software platform for people who are building and using robots. This common platform lets people share code and ideas more readily and, perhaps more importantly, means that you do not have to spend years writing software infrastructure before your robots start moving!</p>

              <span class="text" id="span_000019" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#span_000019">ROS has been remarkably successful. At the time of writing, in the official distribution of ROS, there are over 2,000 software packages, written and maintained by almost 600 people. Approximately 80 commercially available robots are supported, and we can find at least 1,850 academic papers that mention ROS. We no longer have to write everything from scratch, especially if we're working with one of the many robots that support ROS, and can spend more time thinking about</span>

            <p id="p_000019" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000019">So, why should you learn ROS? The short answer is because it will save you time. ROS provides all the parts of a robot software system that you would otherwise have to write. It allows you to focus on the parts of the system that you care about, without worrying about the parts that you don't care about.</p>

What we've tried to do in this book is to lay things out in a more ordered way and to give comprehensive examples of how you can use ROS to do interesting things with real and simulated robots. We've also tried to include tips and hints about how to structure your code, how to debug your code when it causes the robot to do something unexpected, and how to become part of the ROS community.</span>

            <p id="p_000021" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000021">There's a fair amount of complexity in ROS, especially if you're not a seasoned programmer; distributed computation, multithreading, event-driven programming, and a host of other concepts lie at the heart of the system. If you're not already familiar with at least some of these, ROS can have a daunting learning curve. This book is an attempt to flatten out that curve a bit by introducing you to the basics of ROS and giving you some practical examples of how to use it for real applications on real (and simulated) robots.</p>

We make certain implicit assumptions about the robots that you will be using. They are probably running Linux, and have decent computational resources (at least equivalent to a laptop computer). They have sophisticated sensors, such as a Microsoft Kinect. They are ground-based, and probably can move about the world. If your robots don't fall into at least some of these categories, the examples in this book might not be immediately relevant to you, although the material on the underlying mechanisms and tools should be.</p>
                <p id="p_000026" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000026">This book is primarily about ROS, and not about robotics. While you will learn a bit about robotics here, we don't go into great depth about many of the algorithms in ROS. If you're looking for a broad introduction to robotics, then this book isn't the one you're looking for.</p>

We'll cover the important aspects of the basic mechanisms and tools that make up the core of ROS and show you how to use them to create software to control your robots. We'll show you concrete examples of how you can use ROS to do some interesting things with your robots and give you advice on how to build on these examples to create your own systems.</p>

Since ROS is a software framework, you really need to know how to program to properly understand it. Although it's possible to program in ROS in a variety of languages, in this book we're going to be using Python. If you don't know Python, then a lot of the code here isn't going to make much sense. Fortunately, Python</span>

We'll try to introduce the important parts of Linux as we go, but having a basic understanding of the filesystem, the bash command shell, and at least one text editor will help you concentrate on the ROS-specific material.</p>
                <p id="p_000029" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000029">A basic understanding of robotics, while not strictly necessary to learn ROS, will also be helpful. Knowing something about the underlying mathematics used by robotics, such as coordinate transforms and kinematic chains, will be useful for understanding some of the ROS mechanisms that we talk about. Again, we'll try to give a brief introduction to some of this material, but if you're not familiar with it, you might want to take a side track and dig into the robotics literature to fill in some background.</p>

We'd also like to thank everyone who gave us feedback on early drafts of the book, especially Andreas Bihlmaier, Jon Bohren, Zach Dodds, and Kat Scott. Their comments and suggestions made this a much better book.</p>
                <p id="p_000054" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000054">Thanks, also, to everyone who's helped us figure out how to make ROS do the right thing on our robots. Mike Ferguson helped with the Fetch examples. Steve Peters, Nate Koenig, and John Hsu from the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) answered some gnarly Gazebo simulation questions. William Woodall and Tully Foote (both from the OSRF) fielded a number of general ROS hacking questions.</p>
                <p id="p_000055" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000055">Thanks as well to Dylan Jones, who caught a code bug at the last minute before the book went to press.</p>
                <p id="p_000056" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000056">Finally, we'd like to thank all of the authors, maintainers, and users in the worldwide ROS community. If it wasn't for them, ROS would not be what it is today, and we would not be writing this preface.</p>

            <p id="p_000059" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000059">Consider a simple "fetch an item" task, where an office-assistant robot is instructed to retrieve a stapler. First, the robot must understand the request, either verbally or through some other modality, such as a web interface, email, or even SMS. Then, the robot must start some sort of planner to coordinate the search for the item, which will likely require navigating through various rooms in a building, perhaps including elevators and doors. Once arriving in a room, the robot must search desks cluttered with similarly sized objects (since all handheld objects are roughly the same size) and find a stapler. The robot must then retrace its steps and deliver the stapler to the desired location. Each of those subproblems can have arbitrary numbers of complicating factors. And this was a relatively simple task!</p>

For example, in the "fetch a stapler" problem, one organization might have experts in mapping indoor environments and could contribute a complex yet easy-to-use system for producing indoor maps. Another group might have expertise in using maps to robustly navigate indoor environments. Yet another group might have discovered a particular computer vision approach that works well for recognizing small objects in clutter. ROS includes many features specifically designed to simplify this type of large-scale collaboration.</span>

The need for an open collaboration framework was felt by many people in the robotics research community. Various projects at Stanford University in the mid-2000s involving integrative, embodied AI, such as the STanford AI Robot (STAIR) and the Personal Robots (PR) program, created in-house prototypes of the types of flexible, dynamic software systems described in this book. In 2007, Willow Garage, Inc., a nearby robotics incubator, provided significant resources to extend these concepts much further and create well-tested implementations. The effort was boosted by countless researchers who contributed their time and expertise to the core of ROS and its fundamental software packages. Throughout, the software was developed in the open using the permissive BSD open source license, and it gradually became widely used in the robotics research community.</p>
                <p id="p_000061" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00001.smil#p_000061">From the start, ROS was being developed at multiple institutions and for multiple robots. At first, this seemed like a headache, since it would have been far simpler for all contributors to place their code on the same servers. Ironically, over the years, this has emerged as one of the great strengths of the ROS ecosystem: any group can start their own ROS code repository on their own servers, and they will maintain full ownership and control of it. They don't need anyone's permission. If they choose to make their repository publicly visible, they can receive the recognition and credit they deserve for their achievements and benefit from specific technical feedback and improvements like all open source software projects.</p>

Broadly speaking, ROS follows the Unix philosophy of software development in several key aspects. This tends to make ROS feel "natural" for developers coming from a Unix background but somewhat "cryptic" at first for those who have primarily used graphical development environments on Windows or Mac OS X. The following paragraphs describe several philosophical aspects of ROS:</p>

Unlike many other robotics software frameworks, ROS does not have a canonical integrated development and runtime environment. Tasks such as navigating the source code tree, visualizing the system interconnections, graphically plotting data streams, generating documentation, logging data, etc. are all performed by separate programs. This encourages the creation of new, improved implementations, since (ideally) they can be exchanged for implementations better suited for a particular task domain. Recent versions of ROS allow many of these tools to be composed into single processes for efficiency or to create coherent interfaces for operators or debugging, but the principle remains the same: the individual tools themselves are relatively small and generic.</p>

This book will use the Python client library almost exclusively, to save space in the code examples and for its general ease of use.

Commercial product development is often done completely behind a firewall. All of these use cases, and more, are common and perfectly valid under the ROS license.</p>

Ubuntu provides an easy-to-use installer that allows computers to dual-boot between the operating system they were shipped with (typically Windows or Mac OS X) and Ubuntu itself. That being said, it is important to back up your computer before installing Ubuntu, in case something unexpected happens and the drive is completely erased in the process.</p>

As such, we recommend running Ubuntu Linux natively by following the instructions on the Ubuntu website.</p>

ROS systems are comprised of a large number of independent programs that are constantly communicating with each other. In this chapter, we'll discuss this architecture and look at the command-line tools that interact with it. We'll also discuss the details of the naming schemes and namespaces used by ROS, and how these can be employed to promote reuse of your code.</p>

Imagine a relatively large and complex robot with several cameras and laser scanners, a manipulator arm, and a wheeled base. In the "fetch an item" problem, the robot's task is to navigate a typical home or office environment, find the requested item, and deliver it to the requested location. This task, like many robotics tasks, led to several observations about many robotics software applications, which became some of the design goals of ROS:</p>

This offers additional fault tolerance: a software crash will typically only take down its own process. The rest of the graph will stay up, passing messages and functioning as normal. The circumstances leading up to the crash can often be recreated by logging the messages entering a node and simply playing them back at a later time inside a debugger.</span>

This property is commonly seen in ROS graphs and can serve as a check on a software architecture: if a ROS graph starts looking like a star, where most nodes are streaming data to or from a central node, it is often worthwhile to re-assess the flow of data and separate functions into smaller pieces. The goal is to create small, manageable functional units, which ideally can be reused in other applications on other robots.</span>

In general, you can choose the origin arbitrarily, though there's usually a widely used convention that should be followed. For example, a mobile base should have its origin at the geometric centroid of the base, with the positive x-axis pointing forward, the positive y-axis pointing left, and the positive z-axis pointing up (you could have inferred the z-axis direction because we always use righthanded coordinate systems). Other than following such conventions, the important thing is that everyone understand and agree on (usually via documentation) where each component's origin is.</span>

And if we're going to use the base-mounted camera to find items in the environment, then we likely need to know the camera's pose with respect to the base. If we're going to use the locations of items found by the camera to send goals to the hand, then we further need to know the pose of the camera with respect to the hand. This case is especially interesting because the camera-to-hand relationship might be changing all the time as the arm moves the hand with respect to the camera. Then you have the mobile base moving around in the world (e.g., defined by a map), so there's a base-to-world relationship that is also constantly changing.</span>

Some relationships are static (e.g., a laser bolted to a base), while others are dynamic (e.g., a hand reaching to grasp an item). We need to capture and combine all of these relationships, ideally in such a way that we can easily convert sensor data and actuator commands among them, while doing as little math as possible (because if we do the math ourselves, we'll just get it wrong).

In ROS, continuing with the philosophy of keeping things small and modular, we take a distributed approach, using ROS topics to share transform data. Any node can be the authority that publishes the current information for some transform(s), and any node can subscribe to transform data, gathering from all the various authorities a complete picture of the robot.

For example, the driver that talks to a robot arm and has direct access to its joint encoder data might be the best node to publish the information about the transform from the start of the arm to the hand at the other end.</span>

ROS already has a rich set of message types, and you should use one of these if you can. Part of the power of ROS is the ability to combine nodes together to form complex systems, and this can only happen if nodes publish and receive messages of the same type. So, before you go and create a new message type, you should use</span>

ROS messages define the public interface between nodes. Nodes that use the same messages can easily be combined into a running system. However, if every node uses a different message for similar data, then you'll have to do a lot of (pointless) work translating between these messages in order to get something working. You should prefer existing message types whenever you can, since this will make your code fit in more seamlessly with the existing ROS code base. Similarly, you should use SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.) whenever possible, since this is what the rest of ROS uses.</span>

In fact, one of the most common things nodes in ROS do is to transform data by performing computations on it. For example, a node might subscribe to a topic containing camera images, identify faces in those images, and publish the positions of those faces in another topic.</span>

Services are just synchronous remote procedure calls; they allow one node to call a function that executes in another node. We define the inputs and outputs of this function similarly to the way we define new message types. The server (which provides the service) specifies a callback to deal with the service request, and advertises the service. The client (which calls the service) then accesses this service through a local proxy.</p>
            <p id="p_000313" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00004.smil#p_000313">Service calls are well suited to things that you only need to do occasionally and that take a bounded amount of time to complete. Common computations, which you might want to distribute to other computers, are a good example. Discrete actions that the robot might do, such as turning on a sensor or taking a high-resolution picture with a camera, are also good candidates for a service-call implementation.</p>
            <p id="p_000314" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00004.smil#p_000314">Although there are several services already defined by packages in ROS, we'll start by looking at how to define and implement our own service, since this gives some insight into the underlying mechanisms of service calls. As a concrete example in this chapter, we're going to show how to create a service that counts the number of words in a string.</p>

These messages are used to implement the action client/server protocol, which, as mentioned previously, is built on top of ROS topics. The generated message definitions are in turn processed by the message generator to produce corresponding class definitions. Most of the time, you'll use only a few of those classes, as you'll see in the following examples.</span>

Any time you need to be able trigger a behavior, actions are probably the right tool for the job. In fact, any time that you're using a service, it's worth considering replacing it with an action; actions require a bit more code to use, but in return they're much more powerful and extensible than services. We'll see many examples in future chapters where actions provide rich but easy-to-use interfaces to some pretty complex behaviors.</span>

            <p id="p_000465" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00005.smil#p_000465">The previous chapters discussed many fundamental concepts of ROS. They may have seemed rather vague and abstract, but those concepts were necessary to describe how data moves around in ROS and how its software systems are organized. In this chapter, we will introduce common robot subsystems and describe how the ROS architecture handles them. Then, we will introduce the robots that we will use throughout the remainder of the book and describe the simulators in which we can most easily experiment with them.</p>

In the ROS context, actuation subsystems are the subsystems that interact directly with how the robot's wheels or arms move. Sensing subsystems interact directly with sensor hardware, such as cameras or laser scanners. Finally, the computational subsystems are what tie actuators and sensing together, with (ideally) some relatively intelligent processing that allows the robot to perform useful tasks. We will introduce these subsystems in the next few sections. Note that we are not attempting to provide an exhaustive discussion; rather, we are trying to describe these subsystems just deeply enough to convey the issues typically faced when interacting with them from a software development standpoint.</span>

This is because of two main reasons. First, wheeled platforms are often simpler to design and manufacture. Second, for the very smooth surfaces that are common in artificial environments, such as indoor floors or outdoor pavement, wheels are the most energy-efficient way to move around.</p>

The simplest dynamically stable wheeled robots look like (and often are literally built upon) Segway platforms, with a pair of large differential-drive wheels supporting a tall robot above. Among the benefits of balancing wheeled mobile bases is that the wheels contacting the ground can have very large diameters, which allows the robot to smoothly drive over small obstacles: imagine the difference between running over a pebble with an office-chair wheel versus a bicycle wheel (this is, in fact, precisely the reason why bicycle wheels are large). Another advantage of balancing wheeled mobile robots is that the footprint of the robot can be kept small, which can be useful in tight quarters.</span>

One advantage is that skid steering provides maximum traction while preserving mechanical simplicity (and thus controlling cost), since all contact points between the vehicle and the ground are being actively driven. However, skid steering is, as its name states, constantly skidding when it is not driving exactly forward or backward.</p>
                    <p id="p_000468" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00005.smil#p_000468">In some situations, traction and the ability to surmount large obstacles are valued so highly that skid steering platforms are used extensively. However, all this traction comes at a cost: the constant skidding is tremendously inefficient, since massive energy is spent tearing up the dirt (or heating up the wheels) whenever the robot turns at low speeds. In the most extreme case, when trying to turn in place with one set of wheels turning forwards and the other turning backward, the wheels are skidding dramatically, which can tear up gentle surfaces and wear tires quickly. This is why excavators are typically towed to a construction site on a trailer!</p>

Placing the wheels at the extreme corners of the vehicle maximizes the area of the supporting polygon, which is why cars can turn sharp corners without tipping over and (when not driven in action movies) car wheels do not have to skid when turning. However, the downside of Ackerman platforms is that they cannot drive sideways, since the rear wheels are always facing forward. This is why parallel parking is a dreaded portion of any driver's license examination: elaborate planning and sequential actuator maneuvers are required to move an Ackerman platform sideways.</span>

However, expressing velocities in three dimensions allows path planning or obstacle avoidance software to be used by vehicles capable of more general motions, such as aerial, underwater, or space vehicles. It is important to recognize that even for vehicles designed for two-dimensional navigation, the general three-dimensional twist methodology is necessary to express desired or actual motions of many types of actuators, such as grippers, since they are often capable of three-dimensional motions when flying on the end of a manipulator arm even when the mobile base is constrained to the floor plane. Manipulators, in fact, comprise the other main application domain for robot actuators and will be discussed in the next section.</span>

Generally speaking, having a larger dextrous workspace is a good thing for robots, but unfortunately full (360-degree) range of motion on six joints of a robot is often extremely difficult to achieve at reasonable cost, due to constraints of mechanical structures, electrical wiring, and so on. As a result, seven-DOF arms are often used. The seventh DOF provides an extra degree of freedom that can be used to move the links of the arm while maintaining the position and orientation of the wrist, much as a human arm can move its elbow through an arc segment while maintaining the wrist in the same position. This "extra" DOF can help contribute to a relatively large dextrous workspace even when each individual joint has a restricted range of motion.</span>

These quirks can often be surprisingly severe. For example, a range sensor may have a "minimum distance" restriction: if an object is closer than that minimum distance, it will not be sensed. As a result of these quirks, it is often advantageous to combine several different types of sensors in a robotic system.</p>

This sounds simple, but as always, the devil is in the details. The performance of a stereo camera depends on a large number of factors, such as the quality of the camera's mechanical design, its resolution, its lens type and quality, and so on.

Fierce debates have raged throughout the history of robotics as to exactly how much computer processing is required to produce robust, useful robot behavior. Insect brains, for example, are extremely small and power-efficient, yet insects are arguably the most successful life forms on the planet. Biological brains process data very differently from "mainstream" systems-engineering approaches of human technology, which has led to large and sustained research projects that study and try to replicate the success of bio-inspired computational architectures.</p>

ROS can run on small-form-factor embedded computer systems such as Gumstix, Raspberry Pi, or BeagleBone, among many others. Going up the performance and power curve, ROS has been widely used on a large range of laptops, desktops, and servers. Human-scale robots often carry one or more standard PC motherboards running Linux headless, which are accessed over a network link.</p>

In many ways, it was the "ultimate" research platform for service-robotics software at the time of its release in 2010. Its mobile base is actuated by four steerable casters and has a laser scanner for navigation. Atop this mobile base, the robot has a telescoping torso that carries two human-scale seven-DOF arms. The arms have a unique passive mechanical counterbalance, which permits the use of surprisingly low-power motors for human-scale arms.</p>

Additionally, each forearm of the robot has a camera, and the gripper fingertips have tactile sensors. All told, the PR2 has two laser scanners, six cameras, a depth camera, four tactile arrays, and 1 kHz encoder feedback. All of this data is handled by a pair of computers in the base of the robot, with an onboard gigabit network connecting them to a pair of WiFi radios.</p>

To control cost, the TurtleBot relies on a depth camera for range sensing; it does not have a laser scanner. Despite this, mapping and navigation can work quite well for indoor spaces.

At first glance, this seems to defeat the whole purpose of robotics; after all, the very definition of a robot involves perceiving and/or manipulating the environment. Software robots, however, are extraordinarily useful. In simulation, we can model as much or as little of reality as we desire. Sensors and actuators can be modeled as ideal devices, or they can incorporate various levels of distortion, errors, and unexpected faults. Although data logs can be used in automated test suites to verify that sensing algorithms produce expected results, automated testing of control algorithms typically requires simulated robots, since the algorithms under test need to be able to experience the consequences of their actions.</span>

These include trade-offs in speed, accuracy, graphics quality, dimensionality (2D versus 3D), types of sensors supported, usability, platform support, and so on. No simulator of which we are aware is capable of maximizing all of those attributes simultaneously, so the choice of the "right" simulator for a particular task will be dependent on many factors.</p>

By now, you should have a pretty good idea of what a robot looks like, and you should be starting to figure out how ROS might be used to control one, reading data from the sensors, figuring out how to interpret that data and what to do, and sending commands to the acutators to make it move.</p>

Then, the previous chapter introduced many of the sensing and actuation subsystems commonly found in modern robots. In this chapter, we will put these concepts together to create a robot that can wander around its environment. This might not sound terribly earth-shattering, but such a robot is actually capable of doing meaningful work: there is an entire class of tasks that are accomplished by driving across the environment. For example, many vacuuming or other floor-cleaning tasks can be accomplished by cleverly designed and carefully tuned algorithms where the robot, carrying its cleaning tool, traverses its environment somewhat randomly. The robot will eventually drive over all parts of the environment, completing its task.</p>

Finally, we closed the loop between sensing and actuation by creating Wander-bot, a program that causes the Turtlebot to avoid obstacles and randomly wander around its environment. This brought together all of the aspects of the book thus far: the streaming data transport mechanisms of ROS, the discussion of robot sensors and actuators, and the simulation framework of Gazebo. In the next chapter, we will start making things more complex by listening to user input, as we create Teleop-bot.</span>

Since ROS is a distributed system with topic-based communications, we can quickly create testing environments to help our debugging, so that we are only starting and stopping a single piece of the system every time we need to tweak a bit of code. Structuring our software as a collection of very small message-passing programs makes it easier and more productive to insert ROS debugging tools into these message flows.</p>

As a result, when a robot's wheel motors try to instantly jump to a wildly different velocity, typically something bad happens, such as skidding, belts slipping, "shuddering" as the robot repeatedly hits electrical current limits, or possibly even something breaking in the mechanical driveline. To avoid these problems, we should</span>

However, it is often impossible or undesirable to maintain line-of-sight contact with the robot. This requires the teleoperator to visualize the robot's sensors and see the world through the "eyes" of the robot. ROS provides several tools to simplify development of such systems, including</span>

In order to do this, the robot needs to know where it is, and where you want it to go to. Typically, this means that it needs to have a map of the world and to know where it is in this map. In this chapter, we're going to see how to build a high-quality map of the world, using data from your robot's sensors. We'll then use these maps in the next chapter when we talk about how to make the robot move about in the world.</p>
            <p id="p_000624" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00008.smil#p_000624">If your robot had perfect sensors and knew exactly how it was moving, then building a map would be simple: you could take the objects detected by the sensors, transform them into some global coordinate frame (using the robot's position and some geometry), and then record them in a map (in this global coordinate frame). Unfortunately, in the real world, it's not quite that easy. The robot doesn't know exactly how it's moving, since it's interacting with an uncertain world. No sensor is perfect, and you'll have to deal with noisy measurements. How can you combine all this error-laden information together to produce a usable map?</p>
            <p id="p_000625" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00008.smil#p_000625">Luckily, ROS has a set of tools that will do this for you. The tools are based on some quite advanced mathematics, but, luckily, you don't have to understand everything that's going on under the hood in order to use them. We'll describe these tools in this chapter, but first let's talk a bit about exactly what we mean by "map."</p>

Images are indexed from the top left, with the y-axis going down the image, and store integer values, often from 0 to 255. High values (such as 255) correspond to white, and low values (such as 0) correspond to black. Maps, on the other hand, can have an arbitrary origin, specified in the YAML file. Since maps are probabilistic representations of the world, high values correspond to something being there, and low values correspond to empty space. Since we're used to using paper, most people associate black with something there and white with nothing there when using a map.</p>

A common use of this is to stop the robot from planning paths through certain areas of the map by, for example, drawing a line across a corridor you don't want to the robot to drive through, as you can see in</span>

This repeatability will speed up your debugging, since you can guarantee that any changes in behavior are caused by changes in your code, and not by some new sensor input that you've never seen before. Even if the world does not change and your sensor does not move, measurement errors mean that you'll never see the same stream of sensor data twice. This will slow down your debugging, especially for complex algorithms.</span>

Since it was created from sensor data taken from a robot, it includes some things you might not expect. Along the bottom edge of the map, the wall seems to have holes in it. These are caused by bad sensor readings, possibly the result of clutter under the desks in those rooms. The strange blob in the largish room toward the top in the middle is a pool table. The gray spots in the larger room going diagonally down and right are chair legs (this was a conference room). The walls are not always perfectly straight, and there are sometimes "unknown" areas in the middle of rooms if the sensors never made measurements there. When you start to make maps of your own with your robot, you should be prepared for them to look like this. Generally speaking, using more data to create the map will result in a better map. However, no map will be perfect. Even though the maps might not look all that great to you, they're still perfectly useful to the robot, as we will see.</span>

First, it is not axis-aligned. When the robot was collecting data to build the map, the odometry data coordinate frame was aligned with the starting position of the robot, which means that the final map is rotated a bit. We can fix this in the YAML file if we want to, although it doesn't affect the robot's ability to navigate.</span>

Although the corridors and open spaces are fairly clean, there seem to be a lot of long, skinny open spaces coming off these open spaces. These are actually rooms that the robot did not drive into. As the robot drove past these rooms, the laser range-finder made some measurements into them, but there wasn't enough data to reconstruct a decent map of each room. Again, this won't affect the ability of the robot to localize itself, but it does mean that we might not be able to get the robot to navigate into these rooms autonomously, since they're technically not in the map.</p>

When the robot tries to plan a path in the map, these areas will be considered to be occupied, and it will not plan a path through them. This change will affect the robot's ability to localize itself a bit, especially when it is near the doorway to this space. Localization involves comparing the current sensor readings to the map, to make sure the robot is seeing what it expects to in a given location. Since there's an obstacle in the map (the big black blob) that doesn't match up with something in the real world, the robot's confidence in where it is will be lower.

To do this effectively, the robot needs to know where it is and where it should be going. This is usually acheived by giving the robot a map of the world, a starting location, and a goal location. In the previous chapter, we saw how to build a map of the world from sensor data. Now, we'll look at how to make your robot autonomously navigate from one part of the world to another, using this map and the ROS navigation packages. We'll start by helping the robot to figure out where it is.</p>

For each candidate pose, if the readings are consistent with the map, then the probability of that pose increases. If the readings are inconsistent, then the probability decreases. Over time, candidate poses with very low probability (i.e., where the robot is most likely not really in that pose) go away, while those with high probability stick around.

This is one of the trade-offs of using probabilistic algorithms; they're really robust and work well most of the time, but you can't guarantee that they're completely accurate. However, they're usually accurate enough for path planning and, when combined with a sensor-based local path-following algorithm, for navigation.</span>

It integrates information from the map, localization system, sensors, and odometry to plan a good path from the current position to the goal position, and then follows it to the best of the robot's ability. If the robot gets stuck, usually because of some unmapped obstacles, it can replan and recover. The nav stack is one of the most heavily used parts of ROS, since almost every robot that moves uses it.</p>

Give the robot a new pose estimate a little bit away from its actual location, and notice how the set of candidate poses spreads out again. Now, give it a nav goal a small distance away, and watch what happens to the set of candidate poses. Either the navigation stack failed because the pose estimate was just too far off to recover from, or the pose estimate converged on the robot's position. If navigation failed, then try again, making the pose estimate a little closer to the robot's actual position than the last time. Keep trying it until you can get the localization estimate to converge, so that you can get a sense of how far off you can be and still recover.</span>

This was because planar robot navigation can be explored using relatively low-cost hardware, and the topic is sufficiently valuable, complex, and nuanced to use it as a practical introduction to controlling robots using ROS. However, the field of robotics is far larger than planar mobile robots! In this chapter, we will enter an entirely different domain:</span>

              <span class="text" id="span_002542" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00010.smil#span_002542">. Unfortunately, robot manipulators are often complex and expensive machines, making them less commonly found in academic and hobbyist laboratories. Fortunately, it's possible, and strongly encouraged, to develop robot-manipulation software entirely using the free and open source Gazebo simulator! In this chapter, we will use Gazebo extensively to demonstrate how to develop software for the Robonaut 2 (also known as R2), a stunning state-of-the-art robot developed by NASA and GM. One copy of Robonaut 2 is actually on the International Space Station, and the software you will write in this chapter will run just as well in the Gazebo simulator on your personal computer as it would run on the actual R2 on the space station!</span>

A major effort when designing a workcell is thus to ensure that the workpiece--for example, a partially finished car body--always arrives in precisely the same location before the robotic manipulator starts its preplanned motion. This is the type of functionality that we will develop in this chapter; we won't use perceptual data until later in the book.</span>

We will absolutely not present a complete theoretical derivation of robotic manipulation! That deserves an entire book (or bookshelf) of its own. In this book, we will cover just enough of the principles to help explain the complexity of the tools.</p>

Many robots include a combination of revolute and prismatic joints. However, to reduce the size, weight, and cost of the robot while maximizing the workspace size, many manipulators include only revolute joints. As a result, for the remainder of this chapter, we will exclusively discuss revolute joints.</p>

Typically, robotic links are made from a relatively rigid material, such as aluminum or hard plastic. In this book, we will assume that links are truly rigid. In many domains, this assumption is not always correct, because the links are heavily loaded, they are moving very quickly, or both, which requires complex analysis to ensure stable control. We won't go there. For the purposes of the following discussion, links are rigid sections of material that connect joints. These fundamental terms are illustrated by the sketch in</span>

They often have a relatively delicate end effector attached to the very end of the manipulator, which is of course the part of the manipulator that experiences the highest velocities and is most likely to crash into something.</p>

As a consequence, it is very expensive and is not the type of platform you'd want to use when carelessly experimenting with some new code you've hacked together. Fortunately, NASA has released a Gazebo model of an R2, which we can easily install. Then, we can instantiate R2 in Gazebo and aggressively prototype our software, risking none of the guilt associated with wrecking millions of dollars' worth of equipment!</p>

Fortunately for us, MoveIt already includes all of the configuration details for the R2, such as the geometries of all its links, the joint positions and orientations, and so on. We can simply tell MoveIt where we want the end effectors to be positioned, and MoveIt will perform the necessary high-dimensional computational geometry to produce a collision-free path to the goal.</p>

This prevents the robot from nearing the singularities or collisions that can occur if the elbow gets jammed up against the torso or flies up toward the vertical. You'll also notice that the joint velocities smoothly ramp up and down during acceleration and deceleration of the arms.

How did we know that the chessboard is 1 meter above the floor and 30 cm in front of the R2? What if our robot were in a boisterous chess club where the chessboard could be bumped and moved a few centimeters? The robot would have no idea. When it tried to move a piece, it would miss, which would be embarrassing. It would lose the chess match.</p>
                <p id="p_000748" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00011.smil#p_000748">And yet, many successful robots are programmed precisely like this. Most "classical" industrial robots, for example, operate conceptually in the same manner as the previous script: various important poses are "taught" to the robot by skilled operators using a "teach pendant" that allows them to fly the robot arm to various key positions and record them. So long as the environment and task never change, as is the case in many industrial applications, this works perfectly well. Just don't try it in a rowdy chess club!</p>

For our Chess-bot, we will only need two states for the hand: a "pinch" grasp of some sort, and a pose that we will use just before pinching, which we'll call "pre-pinch." We can hardcode those postures and send them to MoveIt, which will then ensure that acceleration/deceleration limits are observed and that self-collisions do not occur--since we don't want to have the fingers crash into each other. Although there are more sophisticated approaches, this strategy of hardcoding a few useful postures is common in robotics, especially in domains where the environment is perfectly known ahead of time.

Although we could copy their world and launch files and modify them, it is easier to instantiate the chessboard and pieces from Python by spawning the models inside an existing running simulation. This approach also allows us to reset the game board as necessary, without having to restart the simulation. This will be convenient as we are tuning the motion sequences.</p>

Many PhD dissertations have been granted for this topic, which becomes arbitrarily complex when considering the variability and noise associated with, for example, roadway striping. Fortunately, in our case we are just going to consider an optimally painted, optimally illuminated bright yellow line. Our strategy will be to filter a block of rows of the image by color and drive the robot toward the center of the pixels that pass the color filter. The first step, then, is to filter the image by color. The purpose of this exercise is not just to show how to follow lines, but to demonstrate how to subscribe to an image stream in ROS and push it though the OpenCV library in Python. This general pipeline could then be used in other application problems by tapping into the wide variety of excellent computer vision algorithms implemented in OpenCV.</p>

The most obvious approach is to find the red, green, blue (RGB) value of a yellow image pixel and filter for nearby RGB values. Unfortunately, filtering on RGB values turns out to be a surprisingly poor way to find a particular color in an image, since the raw RGB values are a function of the overall brightness as well as the color of the object. Slightly different lighting conditions would result in the filter failing to perform as intended. Instead, a better technique for filtering by color is to transform RGB images into hue, saturation, value (HSV) images. The HSV image separates the RGB components into hue (color), saturation (color intensity), and value (brightness). Once the image is in this form, we can then apply a threshold for hues near yellow to obtain a</span>

However, our goal is to follow the line, not just to take interesting pictures of it! To follow the line, we will use a simple strategy: we will only look at a 20-row portion of the image, starting three-quarters of the way down the image. The rationale behind this approach is that, from a controls perspective, we are really only concerned with the portion of the line that is immediately in front of the robot. With this strategy, what happens to the line five meters in front of the robot is irrelevant; our controller will only be concerned with what is in the field of view of the camera approximately one meter in front of the robot.

In this chapter, we'll build on these basic navigation capabilities and look at how to get your robot to patrol around the world, collecting interesting information as it goes. We'll also use this application as an excuse to learn about task-level control of robots, where we sequence entire behaviors rather than single actions.</span>

It does everything that we need to move the robot from one waypoint to the next by making repeated action calls to the nav stack. However, if we also want the robot to do something else while it's navigating or when it reaches a waypoint, we have to write code that synchronizes with the navigation behavior. To make this easier to implement and debug, it makes sense to encapsulate it in some way. In the next section, we're going to see one way of doing this encapsulating, using the idea of state machines and the</span>

The basic idea is that your robot can be in one of a finite number of states, such as "waiting," "moving," and "recharging," each of which maps to a behavior. When one state ends, the system immediately moves into another state (for example, changing from "waiting" to "moving" as the robot starts to navigate around the world). The robot must always be in one and only one of these states, and there must be a finite number of them. Which state the robot transitions to can depend on the outcome of the just-finished state. For example, if the robot just moved to its charging station, it might transition from "moving" to "charging," rather than to "waiting." Once it is charged, then it might transition from "charging" to "waiting." The behaviors that correspond to the states "waiting," "moving," and "charging" can be encapsulated in the states, and the transitions between them are specified by the structure of the state machine.</p>

This type of task is common in many industries where goods are stored with controlled access, from the relatively small "cage" rooms in retail stores where high-value items are stored, to the chemical and medical supply rooms in hospitals, and all the way up through the massive, highly controlled warehouses used to fulfill ecommerce orders and handle the supply chains of large manufacturing corporations. Despite the varied applications, many tasks in these stockrooms are quite similar: items are precisely organized in a restricted-access area, and they need to be gathered in response to incoming requests.</p>
            <p id="p_000879" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00014.smil#p_000879">As we have emphasized throughout this book, it is all but impossible to write robust, complex robot software without a simulation environment. Accordingly, we will spend the first portion of this chapter creating a simulated stockroom. As always, the time spent creating a good simulation model pays huge dividends in robot software development!</p>

Many stockrooms are organized by placing smaller items into a uniform set of bins, which are then labeled with the names of the items they contain. To get started with our stockroom simulation, we will first model a bin. Of course, bins come in all shapes and sizes, depending on the application. In our case, we want to model bins that can hold items that a hand-sized robot gripper can easily pick up, so we'll make our bins 40 cm square and 20 cm tall.</p>
                <p id="p_000887" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00014.smil#p_000887">As usual in ROS and Gazebo, there are many ways that one could accomplish this task. It is possible, for example, to make an intricate model in a 3D modeling or CAD program and export the geometry into a format that Gazebo can understand. However, since we may want to have a large number of bins in our simulated stockroom, we will opt to manually create the bin out of the minimum number of primitive shapes in Gazebo, to make the simulation as fast as possible.</p>
                <p id="p_000888" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00014.smil#p_000888">First, let's make directories in our package for the local Gazebo storage and for our bin model:</p>

In a human-operated stockroom, this is typically done by printing characters on labels that are attached to the bins. However, machine vision often works better with different forms of labels that are easier for algorithms to parse. The retail bar-code system is one well-known example of machine-friendly labeling. There are several newer forms of labeling that extend this concept into two dimensions, such as QR codes, which have impressive information density. However, in robotics, we are often interested not just in extracting text from a label, but also in calculating the orientation and distance of the label relative to the robot. Although there are several options available, in this chapter we will use the ALVAR marker system because it is already integrated with ROS and works quite well "out of the box." ALVAR marker tags are two-dimensional binary images, such as those in</span>

Some care is required to use them appropriately, such as solidly securing the tag's paper printout to a flat surface, and ensuring that the tag is printed at the correct scale; however by and large, ALVAR marker tags can work surprisingly well in a variety of application environments. Happily, there is a ready-made ROS package for recognizing ALVAR tags in ROS</span>

Yet again, we are faced with a choice among an innumerable number of ways that we can do this. We could write a single massive XML file by hand that instantiates the bin model as many times as needed. That would work, but it would be painful if we decided we wanted a slightly different bin spacing in our simulated stockroom, which would require hand-editing many constants in the XML. We could also spawn the bin models programmatically, like we did for the chessboard. That would incur a bit of startup time, but it could work.

This is due to many factors, including localization noise and the navigation system's goal tolerance, since, especially on differential-drive robots like the Fetch, the navigation system doesn't want the robot to have to do many "parallel-park" maneuvers to budge sideways a few centimeters. All navigation systems have a nonzero goal tolerance, within which the navigation system just declares victory and stops trying to reposition the robot. All of these parameters will vary depending on the robot and environment, but in our simulated Fetch system, we can expect position errors of plus or minus 10 centimeters.

The transformation chain is actually quite complex in this case: working backward, we know we want the robot to grasp (for example) 28 cm directly in front and 10 cm below the ALVAR marker of the bin we are interested in. Since we have seen the ALVAR marker in the camera frame, we can estimate the distance and orientation of the ALVAR marker relative to the camera. From there, we can use the joint encoders of the head and torso joints of the Fetch robot to derive the transformation between the camera and the base of the robot, which we can then feed as a goal state to the arm's motion planner.</p>

The "boxy" appearance is OctoMap's data structure: the world is represented as a series of small cubes.

This task is processor-intensive, which is why motion planning often takes a few seconds to complete.</span>

As discussed previously, the robot's navigation system will deliver the robot in front of the bin, but with a typical positioning error on the order of +/- 10 cm due to map discretization, sensor noise, and a host of other factors. The arm motion planner can use all of the joints of the arm (and on the Fetch robot, the torso-lift joint) to deliver the gripper to a precise location relative to the fiducial marker on the back of the bin. So long as the arm doesn't crash into anything, the motion planner is free to be "creative" in what arm postures and trajectories it uses.</p>

Various tools in the ROS and Gazebo ecosystem were utilized to develop an approach to the problem. First, we developed a Gazebo model of the environment. Next, we mapped this simulated environment and created scripts to drive the robot to the various storage bins. Then, we developed a script for the robot to use visual fiducial markers to precisely determine locations within the storage bins and grasp objects from known locations relative to the bins. The final code example showed how to drive the robot to the customer counter, drop the item, and return the robot to the stockroom.</p>

Of course, in the interest of simplifying the examples, we did not provide robust error handling or a notification system so that the robot can "call a friend" when it gets stuck. We also did not describe a user interface. All of these additional aspects can be developed with existing or modified ROS tools: the Robot Web Tools system can be used to interface user-facing web interfaces to ROS systems, for example. The simulation environment and building-block scripts developed in this chapter could then be used to allow user experience (UX) designers to develop the user-facing interface purely in simulation, which would permit huge time savings and automated interface testing.</p>

However, the field of robotics is full of custom hardware! Fortunately, ROS was designed with custom hardware in mind, since it had multiple evolving robots in its user base from day one. In the next few chapters, we will demonstrate how to add custom robots into various components of the ROS ecosystem.</p>

Although ROS covers a wide variety of popular sensors and actuators, it doesn't cover all of them. As new hardware becomes available, we'll have to bring it into ROS, so that it can be used by the community.</p>
            <p id="p_000998" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00018.smil#p_000998">In this chapter, we'll see how you can integrate new sensors and actuators into the ROS ecosystem. This process is, for the most part, relatively painless; it involves writing ROS wrappers around the APIs that you're already using to access these devices. We'll start off with adding your own sensors.</p>

We're going to assume that the sensor already has a Python API that you can call to get measurements from it, and that you know how to use this API. We're also going to assume that everything is wired up correctly and that you've been able to use this API to successfully read the sensor. Although this seems like common sense, you should always verify that things are working as expected before you start to wrap up a sensor in ROS. If you know that the sensor is working, then anything that goes wrong will be a problem with the ROS wrapper, which will make things easier to debug.</p>

The first is whether the ROS wrapper should stream the values of the sensor over a topic or only give measurements when asked, using a service or action call. This really depends on how you're going to use the data from the sensor, so we're going to cover both approaches here.</p>

Again, you should make this decision based on how you're going to use the sensor and how costly it is to make measurements using your sensor's API. Sometimes it may only make sense to implement one option, but in other cases you may want to implement more than one.</span>

This would be simpler, since we wouldn't have to convert the output of the sensor (an integer from 0 to 99) into a quaternion. We could certainly do that, but it would be less useful, in the long run, than using a quaternion. Angles can be represented in a variety of ways, and ROS has settled on quaternions as the standard. If we have a sensor that returns angles, we should follow the standard and stick to quaternions, even if it's (slightly) more work or we don't think it's necessarily the right decision. The more of the ROS ecosystem (including code that we write ourselves) that sticks to the accepted conventions, the more interoperable everything will be, and the more likely it is that other people will use our code.</span>

Quaternions are a representation of rotation that uses four real-valued numbers. Intuitively, these correspond to a vector (three values) and a rotation around that vector (fourth value). There are several ways to represent quaternions, and it's always best to use the built-in functions in ROS to do the translation. If you do it by hand, you might get the wrong representation by accident and create a bug that's hard to find.</p>

If the process of getting a measurement from the sensor is quick, then you should use a service call for this. If it is slower, then you should probably use an action call. We will illustrate the basic approach with a service call; the action interface will be structured similarly.</p>

For our fake sensor, there are three parts to the device: the volume control, the light, and the rotational position. We'll deal with each of these separately.</p>

If you're going to be constantly sending commands to the hardware, then you should use a topic. If you are occasionally sending commands that get implemented quickly by the hardware, then you should use a service call. Finally, if you're occasionally sending commands that take a long time (or a highly variable amount of time) to complete, then you should use an action. We'll expand on this in the following sections. For now, though, the code for the ROS wrapper around our fake actuator is shown in</span>

The commands are one-way: we're going to set the volume, but there's no feedback on what the current volume is. If we wanted to confirm that the volume actually did get set, then we would use a service call, similar to the example in the next section. However, for now, we're going to assume that the volume will always get set correctly. We're also implicitly assuming that setting the volume is something that happens quickly and is not buffered by the actuator; that is, that the device is capable of responding to a volume-setting request before the next request comes in. If this isn't the case, then one of the other designs might be more appropriate.</p>

All we do is call the volume-setting function with the value from the message. In this case, we're multiplying the value by 100, since the device expects an integer from 0 to 100 and the topic delivers a floating-point number between 1 and 0. We're also capping the range of the value we pass on to be between 0 and 100, so that the volume stays within the bounds expected by the device. The callback is a natural place to do this sort of conversion and bounds checking. It's also a good place to enforce software limits on your hardware devices. For example, if you never wanted the volume on the device to go above 80% of maximum, this would be the place to make that happen.</span>

However, since actions are asynchronous, they don't require the calling node to wait for the command to finish. This is ideal for actions that can take a long time. A great example of this is the navigation stack: we don't want to have to wait until the robot navigates to a goal location, but we do want to know when it gets there.</span>

For sensors, once you decide on the message type, the delivery mechanism (topic, service, or action), and how to access measurements from the sensor, writing a wrapper is quite straightforward. For actuators, the mechanism is (largely) determined by how you are going to interact with the device. Topics are often a good choice if you're going to be constantly sending commands and can afford to lose a message occasionally. If you are going to send commands less frequently, or really need to make sure the commands were acted on, you should use a service (for things that happen quickly) or actions (for things that happen more slowly).</p>

There are lots of great robots out there, but sometimes there isn't one that suits your specific needs. Or perhaps you just want to have the experience of designing and building a robot yourself. Whatever the reason, once you've built your amazing custom robot, how do you go about controlling it with ROS?</p>

While we're framing this chapter as a guide to ROS-controlling your from-scratch custom robot, it applies equally well to any robot that isn't already "ROS-ready," whether a robot built from a kit of parts or an off-the-shelf robot that doesn't yet have ROS support (an increasingly rare occurrence).</p>

We want to write a ROS node that will communicate with the mobile base hardware, in whatever manner is available, then present to the rest of the system a standard ROS interface. This is a common and core concept of ROS:</span>
                  <em id="em_000375" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00020.smil#em_000375">abstraction</em>

Whatever the particulars of a specific robot, in ROS we want to make it look and interact like other robots to which it is similar. Then we can reuse an entire ecosystem of tools and libraries that are designed to work with a standard interface.</span>

                <p id="p_001069" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00020.smil#p_001069">The defining characteristics of the TortoiseBot are that it is mobile and that it is confined to driving on the ground (as opposed to climbing walls or flying). More specifically, because of its kinematic configuration, the TortoiseBot can move in the ways that a tricycle can: it can translate forward and backward (along its x-axis), it can yaw (rotate about its z-axis), and it can do combinations of the two. The TortoiseBot cannot translate side to side (y-axis) or up and down (z-axis). Neither can it roll or pitch its body (rotation about its x- or y-axes, respectively). So, fundamentally, it is sufficient to control the TortoiseBot by sending it a pair of desired velocities:</p>

The details of this step, which is to write a driver, are very much dependent on how the robot hardware is designed and how you can communicate with it. There will be some kind of physical interface, such as USB, along with some kind of communication protocol, which is often custom. If you're lucky, there will also be some code that implements the communication protocol, in which case you could be saved a lot of effort (or not, if the code isn't structured or licensed in a way that makes it easily reusable).</p>

For a robot like the TortoiseBot, this interface is sometimes referred to as the "unicycle model" because it treats the robot as a one-wheeled vehicle that can control its forward and turning speeds independently. The robot is not actually a unicycle, of course, so some translation is needed. For example, the robot might natively operate on a per-wheel basis, accepting desired velocities for individual wheels and reporting back individual wheel rotation data. In that case, your node will need to perform the necessary trigonometric calculations, using knowledge of the kinematic configuration of the robot (wheel diameters, axle lengths, etc.) to convert between individual wheel states and overall robot states. This calculation is usually straightforward; for more complex cases, consult a textbook that covers robot kinematics.</span>

Depending on your application, you might want to give your robot the ability to recognize certain objects, or detect people, or (as we'll do in this chapter) speak. There are many good libraries (many of them open source!) out in the world implementing such algorithms that you could use on your robot. Whenever possible, we recommend that you try the existing libraries, especially the ones with strong reputations for reliability and support. While it's always tempting to build your own, and while in some cases you may eventually end up doing so, you'll get going more quickly--and learn more about what exactly you need--by starting with an existing system that does most of what you want.</p>

                <p id="p_001393" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00024.smil#p_001393">In this chapter, we discussed how to integrate an existing software library into a ROS system, which is often called for when building a robotics application. We worked with the relatively simple example of a text-to-speech system that has just one kind of input (the text to be spoken), but the basic elements apply equally well to other libraries: decide on the appropriate data types, and develop an interface (in this case an action interface); decide on the parameters that will be accepted; and decide how to integrate the library's event loop with your own.</p>
                <p id="ch19-idp43704000" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_19-libraries-asciidoc0" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00024.smil#ch19-idp43704000">Even this relatively simple example resulted in a useful node that could be deployed straight away on a robot (as long as the robot has speakers). The node could, of course, be improved and extended in a number of ways, from exposing more configuration of the speech engine (e.g., which voice is being used), to delivering detailed feedback to clients (e.g., notification of each word having been said). There's almost always more that could be exposed, and the art is in deciding what to leave out.</p>
                <p id="p_001394" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00024.smil#p_001394">In the past few chapters, we've presented examples and discussed patterns for adding devices, robots, and capabilities to ROS. The ease with which the platform can be stretched and extended to cover new use cases is a key feature of ROS--but each new feature brings complexity, and writing good robot software is a challenging task to begin with. With that challenge in mind, the next few chapters will introduce some important tools and techniques that will help you to become an efficient and effective ROS developer.</p>

As such, it is also a potential point of failure. If you kill the master, the situation is usually unrecoverable. Already running nodes and existing topic connections will persist, but new nodes can't be started, and new connections can't be made. Because there is no easy way to reconstruct the state previously held by the master, you will likely need to restart your entire ROS system following the death of the master. If the master is only temporarily unreachable--e.g., because a robot moves out of wireless range--then the system should resume normal operation when the master becomes reachable again. Fortunately, the master is a robust, well-tested tool that is not prone to crashing.</p>

          <div class="chapter" id="ch21-chapter_debugging">
            <p id="ch21-ix_21-debugging-asciidoc0" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="debugging" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00025.smil#ch21-ix_21-debugging-asciidoc0">As you've no doubt noticed by now, robotics applications can be complex. In addition to the usual complexity present in any software system, you have sensors and actuators that are interacting in uncertain ways with the physical (or simulated) world. And, at least in a ROS system, you have a distributed processing graph with many independent processes that are interacting asynchronously through message passing. In short, there are many ways for things to go wrong, and it can sometimes be tricky to figure out what the problem is.</p>
            <p id="p_001484" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00025.smil#p_001484">When you have everything ready, and you hit the "Go" button, and... nothing happens, what do you do?</p>
            <p id="p_001485" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00025.smil#p_001485">Fortunately, ROS provides some powerful tools to assist you in debugging your applications. In this chapter, we'll go over the most commonly used tools, providing some debugging technique suggestions along the way.</p>

If you're in luck, then some part of the system will be telling you exactly what's wrong. Of course, the distributed nature of a ROS system makes error message handling a little more complex than with a single program.</p>
                <p id="p_001486" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00025.smil#p_001486">If you're running a single program, you would reasonably expect to see error messages from that program pop up in a dialog window (if it's a graphical application, like a web browser) or be printed to the terminal where you ran the program (if it's a console application, like a compiler). But ROS is a distributed computing environment, with applications commonly comprising dozens of separate processes, the great majority of them lacking a graphical interface. How can you get error messages from all those processes?</p>

                  <span class="text" id="span_007796" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00025.smil#span_007796">? Or what if you don't have access to the terminal where the nodes were started (e.g., if they were started on the robot as part of the boot sequence)?

We use these custom tools because robotics is a challenging endeavor, combining the complexity inherent in any software with the need to interact asynchronously with the physical world. Writing good robotics software is hard, and there are many more ways to get it wrong than right.</p>

The key is to gain visibility into the workings of the system, which is what the tools described in this chapter provide. Once you can see what's going on, you're on the path to figuring out how to fix it.</p>

If ROS were a finished product--a complete system that satisfied everyone's robotics needs--then the community would not play such a prominent role. But ROS is not finished: it is a living ecosystem of code and documentation, with thousands of people around the world constantly fixing, improving, and extending it. In this chapter, we'll introduce you to the online resources through which you can connect with the ROS community and hopefully become a contributor yourself.</p>

It's easy to get right, as most of us do most of the time: just behave in a reasonable manner. But it's also easy to become frustrated when something isn't working properly, or at least not the way that we think it should work. For those times, here are a few points to keep in mind:</p>

While you might be the first to encounter a particular problem, it's often the case that someone else has been there before and asked about it at ROS Answers. If you don't find an answer to your question in the archive (which at the time of writing contained more than 18,000 questions), then by all means ask it. Here are some guidelines for asking good questions:</p>

If you're asking how to do something, give as much context as you can; it may be that, given information about your goal, someone will suggest an alternative approach. If you've encountered unexpected behavior (e.g., something appears to be broken), then provide steps to reproduce that behavior.</p>

Instead, code is distributed throughout many different repositories, often on a package-by-package basis. This arrangement allows for maximum flexibility in how and where code is stored, what licenses are applied, and how development and releases are handled. To find the repository that contains the code for a particular package, follow the source's link from that package's page in the wiki.</p>

          <div class="chapter" id="ch23-cpp">
            <p id="ch23-ix_23-cplusplus-asciidoc0" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="C++" data-secondary="using, in ROS" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00027.smil#ch23-ix_23-cplusplus-asciidoc0">We chose to use Python for this book for a number of reasons. First, it's an accessible language for people without a lot of computer science background. Second, it has a lot of useful stuff in the core packages, which lets us concentrate on higher-level concepts. Third, ROS has strong support for Python. Fourth, we wanted to pick a single language for all of the examples in the book, and Python seemed like a reasonable choice.</p>
            <p id="p_001630" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00027.smil#p_001630">However, sometimes you're going to want to use another language for your ROS development. Maybe some library that you need to use doesn't have Python support. Maybe you're more comfortable developing in another language. Maybe you want the (often slight) speed advantage that a compiled language brings. In this chapter, we're going to look at how the API in C++, one of the other supported languages, differs from the Python API, and how you can translate the examples in this book to C++. All of the idioms and design patterns for C++, and any other language that has a ROS API, will be the same: we're still going to use callbacks, we're still going to pass messages over topics, and so on. However, the syntax and specific data structures will be a little different. Once you learn how to map the Python examples onto your language of choice, then you'll be able to easily translate examples from one language to another.</p>
            <p id="p_001631" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00027.smil#p_001631">The two best-supported language APIs in ROS are for Python and C++. In this chapter, we'll concentrate on the C++ API, but many of the things that we talk about will apply to APIs in other languages. Once you figure out the syntax and data structure differences, things will start to look the same, and you'll be able to change languages at will.</p>

The short answer is: when it makes your life easier. Since ROS is inherently a distributed system, it's easy to mix nodes written in different languages within the same system, with the messaging system (topics, services, and actions) acting as the glue that holds everything together.</p>

All of the idioms and design patterns that we've talked about previously are the same, regardless of the language that you write your code in; only the syntax and details change. Once you learn how to make these cosmetic changes, you should be able to switch from Python to C++ and back again with ease.</p>

Dealing with it completely would take a whole other book. However, if you're already familiar with the language, then you should be able to take this chapter in one hand and the ROS wiki documentation in the other, and start crafting your own ROS nodes in C++. Or, you can choose a simpler life, and stick with Python. Your choice.</p>

Named after the famed Indian ornithologist, the Salim Ali's fruit bat remains a rare species about which little is known, more than 60 years since it was first collected and mistaken for a short-nosed fruit bat. Confined to rainforests at the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula, in the vicinity of the Western Ghats mountain range that runs along the Arabian Sea, the Salim Ali's fruit bat is one of the more endangered species in a region acknowledged as one of the world's most biodiverse.</span>

Rather, they use long tongues to slurp out the nectar of flowers, or use specially adapted teeth to bite into fruit, from which they often drink only the juice. The consequence of the fruit bat's frequent interaction with flowers is a mutually beneficial relationship known as</span>

The megabat's consumption of fruit--primarily figs or the fruit of the bead tree, in the case of the Salim Ali's fruit bat--also perform the function of dispersing seeds.</span>

            <p id="p_001698" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00034.smil#p_001698">By mechanisms that are not clear, the fruit bat's herbivorous nature has deprived almost all members of the Megachiroptera suborder of the ability to use echolocation. It is possible, according to some research, that the economy of energy achieved by insectivorous bats, whose flight activities also seem to physiologically prepare the bat for the vocalizations that act like submarine pings in echolocation, is not as easily realized by the heartier-meal-eating and generally bigger fruit bats. The megabats' larger eyes and keener sense of smell appear to compensate.</p>
            <p id="p_001699" smilref="Programming_Robots_with_ROS00034.smil#p_001699">The last 25 years of the Salim Ali fruit bat's history have seen its status as a species threatened by extinction change from "rare" to "critically endangered" to the more optimistic "endangered." Research has indicated that there is a greater population and range than was previously recorded, and efforts have been made to discourage the private owners of the land on which the bat maintains roosts from hunting it as a pest or for its rumored medicinal value. However, the outlook for the survival of the species is still not bright, as humans continue to encroach on and fragment its primary habitat.</p>
